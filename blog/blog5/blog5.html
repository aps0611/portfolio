      <p>It’s been a while since I have put pen to paper, or fingers to my keyboard to do something meaningful beyond work and study. And that’s the funny thing about routine- It can be a silent creativity killer- turning your ideas or thoughts into just another checkbox on the list. Yet, at times now and then- some things can shake things up- like a new book on the shelf or a boring subject (as you might perceive while going through the course content)- reminding us how thinking, imagining and writing can be fun.</p>
      <p>That’s how I enrolled into the “Strategies for Professional Development” course at IIT-Madras. To be honest- I remember discussing this with my friend before enrolling- Why this course? Is it not just a silent time killer? But, here I am halfway through the course writing on a late night weekend on why this is the best non-technical course so far.</p>
      <p>One of the best parts about the course has been the push for self reflection- especially when it was about personality profiles(<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" style="color: #4da6ff;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.16personalities.com/</a>). In Team 12(or “the 12th Man”- as Amitabha termed us)- we discovered how diverse we were. For me: my friends always joked- I am very diplomatic in my responses. Through these assessments I at least understood why!. But, let's skip that for now! Since this is just a journal entry!</p>
      <p>Tomorrow we are going to discuss an interesting case and quite a popular one. My role is merely an observer / advisor. But where is the fun in that? And as I prepare to advise, I find myself imagining all the possible things that Stefan could say to Vijay.</p>
      <p>What should Stefan say to Vijay over dinner? (<a href="https://hbr.org/2013/05/the-unmanageable-star-performer" style="color: #4da6ff;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://hbr.org/2013/05/the-unmanageable-star-performer</a>)</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5em; font-size: 1.2em; color: #fff;">FIRST:</p>
      <p>At first glance, the obvious move for Stefan is to sit down with Vijay and address the facts head-on: a revolving door of staff, employee surveys that paint a grim picture, and a team too afraid to speak up. On paper, Vijay’s relentless ambition is a recipe for dazzling short-term results- growth, new clients, and numbers that make the boardroom glow. But beneath those achievements, there’s a growing unease. When leaders lean too heavily on autocratic or transactional styles- making every call themselves and leaving little room for team autonomy- morale and culture inevitably suffer. Stefan could, in theory, choose the direct route and lay it all out for Vijay.</p>
      <p>Yet, this approach is not without peril. It’s a classic dilemma in any firm: star performers like Vijay are often given a long leash, sometimes at the expense of the broader team’s health. Mumbai’s young office desperately needs Vijay’s magic touch to keep the EBITDA and client wins climbing, but unchecked attrition threatens to hollow out the very foundation he helped build. While in theory, everyone is replaceable, losing a star can feel like an existential crisis for a fledgling business. And if Vijay bristles at feedback- as history suggests he might- the fallout could be swift and severe, leaving the firm trapped between losing its top talent or watching its people walk away. There’s rarely a clear middle path!!  organizations wrestle with this tension again and again, and the real test is finding a way to protect both the bottom line and the soul of the workplace</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5em; font-size: 1.2em; color: #fff;">SECOND:</p>
      <p>Another approach that keeps coming up in the discussions- and feels especially resonant as I scroll through the expert commentary- is for Stefan to reframe the conversation entirely. Instead of presenting Vijay with a list of problems, he could position it as a challenge: “You’ve built something truly remarkable here. The growth, the client wins, the reputation- it’s all extraordinary. But as I look at the firms that stand the test of time, the ones with the lowest turnover and the strongest team spirit, I wonder: What would it take for us to get there?”</p>
      <p>This framing, as many have pointed out, shifts the focus from critique to aspiration. It invites Vijay to see the current issues- high attrition, flagging morale- not as failures, but as opportunities to evolve his leadership and leave an even greater legacy. By tying the challenge to Vijay’s own ambition and vision for the Mumbai office, Stefan can tap into his drive for excellence and encourage him to expand his definition of success.</p>
      <p>Most importantly, as the discourse posts also highlights, this approach avoids putting Vijay on the defensive. It acknowledges his achievements while gently nudging him toward a new frontier: building a culture where both results and people thrive. This is the kind of leadership pivot that can turn a star performer into a true leader.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5em; font-size: 1.2em; color: #fff;">THIRD:</p>
      <p>Beyond presenting the challenge or the facts, Stefan can also approach the dinner with genuine curiosity, aiming to listen rather than just talk. He might start by asking Vijay how he sees the current situation in Mumbai- what he’s proud of, what keeps him up at night, and where he thinks the office could be in a few years. This open-ended listening not only builds trust but also gives Vijay space to reflect and perhaps even acknowledge some of the team’s concerns himself.</p>
      <p>Taking it a step further, Stefan could gently explore whether Vijay would be open to evolving the leadership model. Rather than framing it as a problem, he could highlight the growing trend of co-leadership in top firms- where two leaders share responsibilities, bring different strengths to the table, and create a more balanced, sustainable environment. Stefan might ask: “Have you ever considered what it would be like to have a true partner in leadership here? Someone who could complement your skills, help share the load, and maybe even bring fresh perspectives to our team?” </p>
      <p>I think the SECOND & THIRD approach combined would be best- A co-leadership model + A challenge for low attrition rates. </p>
      <p>So, I’m signing off for now- but not for long. Tomorrow’s call is on my mind, and I’m genuinely excited to hear how this case will unfold. There’s always more to learn, more to discuss, and more stories to tell. Until then, I’m left wondering: what would you do if you were in Stefan’s shoes? </p>
      <p>For now, I’ll say:<br>¡Hasta luego! Nos vemos pronto en la próxima entrada.</p>
