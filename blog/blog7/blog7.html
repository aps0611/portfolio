        When Probability Pretends to Agree: Why We Need Friction Back in Our Thinking
      </h1>

      <p>
        It all started as a general chat on our grandmasters whatsapp group, the kind of late-night back-and-forth where we usually vent about podcasts, new models, and more recently how LLMs and LCM differ in their approaches. However, the conversation took a turn that I feel is too important not to document and share with a wider audience. The core realization we reached is a warning: we must stop using LLMs for subjective idea discussions because, at their core, these models are built for sycophancy. They are designed to follow your lead, often agreeing with you or steering into "garden paths" rather than offering the objective friction required for real intellectual growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        What began as a simple comparison between models slowly turned into a bigger question: what are we actually interacting with when we talk to an LLM?
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:40px;">The Reality Check: An LLM Is a Probability Machine</h2>

      <p>
        A Large Language Model is not a thinking partner. It is not reflecting on your idea. It is not judging whether you are right or wrong. Under the hood, it is doing one thing: predicting the next token based on the previous tokens.
      </p>

      <p>In simple terms:</p>

      <p style="background:#111; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; font-family: monospace;">
        P(next token | previous tokens)
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s the core mechanism. No matter how advanced the architecture is, no matter how large the embeddings are, the job remains the same — predict what is most likely to come next.
      </p>

      <p>So when you ask questions like:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>“Is this startup idea viable?”</li>
        <li>“Am I thinking correctly?”</li>
        <li>“Does this research direction make sense?”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You are not getting an independent evaluation. You are getting a continuation shaped by how you framed the question. The model responds based on patterns it has seen before, not because it has formed a belief about your idea.
      </p>

      <p>And that difference is important.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:40px;">The Garden Path Problem: You Lead, It Follows</h2>

      <p>
        There’s a concept in linguistics called a “garden-path” sentence — one that leads you toward a certain interpretation before revealing something different. With LLMs, something similar happens, but in reverse.
      </p>

      <p><strong>You create the path. The model follows it.</strong></p>

      <p>If your prompt says something like:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>“Given that this architecture clearly scales better…”</li>
        <li>“Since this approach is obviously more efficient…”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You’ve already shaped the direction. The model doesn’t step back and ask whether your assumption is valid. It treats it as context and continues from there.
      </p>

      <p>Mathematically, it’s just:</p>

      <p style="background:#111; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; font-family: monospace;">
        P(response | your premise)
      </p>

      <p>
        Because these systems are trained to be helpful and cooperative, they often lean toward agreement. Disagreeing strongly is risky. Supporting your framing is safer. The result feels like thoughtful validation — but it is often just well-structured alignment.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Digital sycophancy.</strong></p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:40px;">The Risk of Asking for Validation</h2>

      <p>
        It’s tempting to use LLMs as a sounding board. You draft an idea and ask:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>“Is this doable?”</li>
        <li>“Am I overthinking this?”</li>
        <li>“Is this innovative?”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The answers usually sound balanced. Encouraging. Reasonable. Sometimes even insightful. But they rarely push back in a meaningful way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Real growth comes from friction. From someone saying, “I don’t think that works.” From someone pointing out blind spots. From being challenged.
      </p>

      <p>
        A probability model cannot truly challenge you. It has no independent position. It does not hold beliefs. It cannot disagree because it thinks you are wrong. It can only generate what is statistically likely and contextually appropriate.
      </p>

      <p><strong>It is optimized for sounding right, not for being right.</strong></p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:40px;">Busting the PR Bubble</h2>

      <p>
        The language we use around AI also deserves scrutiny. Words like “hallucination,” “emergence,” or even “daydreaming” make the systems sound almost human.
      </p>

      <p>
        Technically, these are different kinds of model errors or scaling effects. A “hallucination” is usually a confident prediction error. “Emergent features” are nonlinear scaling effects that appear once models cross certain complexity thresholds. “Daydreaming” is often just attention misallocation or context-window artifacts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The terminology makes it feel alive. The mechanism is still math.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:40px;">Where LLMs Truly Shine</h2>

      <p>LLMs are incredibly powerful when used for objective tasks:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Summarizing long documents</li>
        <li>Extracting structured data</li>
        <li>Refactoring and debugging code</li>
        <li>Exploring large bodies of research</li>
        <li>Acting as fast pattern search engines</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In these areas, they are transformative. They compress, reorganize, and decode information at a scale that would take humans far longer.
      </p>

      <p>
        The problem only appears when we treat them as judges of our thinking.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:40px;">The Illusion of Mind</h2>

      <p>
        These systems do not have goals, intentions, or self-awareness. They do not independently evaluate premises. They do not decide to agree with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        They calculate. They approximate. They continue patterns. And they do it very, very well.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:40px;">The Core Takeaway</h2>

      <p>
        LLMs are exceptional tools for processing and generating language. They can help us think faster, explore wider, and organize better. But they should not replace human disagreement, peer review, or intellectual friction.
      </p>

      <p>
        A smooth answer is not the same as a correct one. Agreement is not validation. Probability, no matter how fluent, is not judgment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The real danger is not that these systems are intelligent — it is that they sound intelligent. When fluency becomes indistinguishable from understanding, we risk outsourcing our thinking to something that was never designed to think. Tools should extend our reasoning, not replace it. If we want better ideas, better research, and better decisions, we need resistance. We need disagreement. We need other minds pushing back.
      </p>

      <p><strong>AI can assist. It can accelerate. It can organize.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>But the hard work of thinking still belongs to us.</strong></p>
